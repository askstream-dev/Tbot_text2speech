This is my project to test the functionality of text2speech while developing a telegram bot.

Please use the command to set the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need config.py file with API keys defined. See example below:

```python

elevenlabs_api_key = "your elevenlabs_api_key"
telegram_bot_token = "your telegram_bot_token"

```
